# eHotelBuffet

The project involves creating a flexible logging framework to track the application's state and execution steps, crucial for debugging and monitoring complex systems. The framework includes a  `Logger`  interface and a  `ConsoleLogger`  implementation, which logs messages with timestamps, message types (INFO or ERROR), and the message content itself. This setup facilitates easy identification of errors and their sources, assuming developers adhere to writing meaningful and detailed log entries.

Additionally, the project encompasses a simulation of a hotel's operations, focusing on guest management, buffet management, and breakfast and dinner services. It involves generating random guest reservations, managing buffet supplies, serving breakfast and dinner, and optimizing operations based on guest preferences and buffet freshness. The simulation aims to optimize guest happiness and minimize food waste, showcasing the importance of effective logging in complex systems to ensure smooth operations and data-driven decision-making.
